How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
	By finding examples of working code that you want to copy.

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
	You can either change them by pixel size or by percentage.

What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
	Absolute: based off of an element's nearest relatively positioned parent element. I think this was hardest because its position is based off of something that can move around.
	Fixed: at a constant position on the screen, not the page.
	Static: They'll be sorted one right after the other in the top left corner. I think this was the easiest one to use.
	Relative: moves dependent on other elements

What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
	Margin: the distance from the edges of the page
	Border: the positive space at the edge of an element
	Padding: the negative space at the edge of an element.
	I thought that this challenge was a good addition. At this stage, positioning is a lot of guess-and-check for me, and this challenge helped me to familiarize myself with many of the positioning terminology. In some ways, I really liked it because I enjoyed being able to change a few things and then immediately see what the effect would be. However, I was getting annoyed whenever Div 1 would override the other commands.
