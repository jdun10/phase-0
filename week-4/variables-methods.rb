# How do you define a local variable?
#	  You set it equal to its placeholder within the method with a = sign.
# How do you define a method?
#   You define a method by typing "def method_name", then setting the parameters of the code, and finishing with "end".
# What is the difference between a local variable and a method?
#   A local variable is a set piece of data that exists only within the method. A method is the execution of all of the contained code.
# How do you run a ruby program from the command line?
#   By typing irb and then putting the whole program in the terminal.
# How do you run an RSpec file from the command line?
#   rspec file_name.rb
# What was confusing about this material? What made sense?
#   Sometimes I would forget about how I need to add spaces inbetween strings myself rather than have them come out all as one word.
