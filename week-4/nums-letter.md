What does puts do?
	puts returns nil and prints the output to the console with a new line.
What is an integer? What is a float?
	Integers are numbers that have a value after the decimal point. Floats are numbers without that value.
What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
	Float division will yield a whole number and disregard the remainder, if there were one. Integer division will include what would have been the remainder into the product. I thought that Pine's example of only being able to buy 4 movie tickets with $9 if they were $2 each was good, but you could use anything that you can't buy part of.

```ruby
puts 365 * 24

puts 60 * 24 * 365 * 10
```

How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
	It treats addition, subtraction, and multiplication the way I had expected, but it divides as with whole numbers unless otherwise specified and ignores the remainder.
What is the difference between integers and floats?
	Integers can have values after the decimal point, but floats are treated as a whole number.
What is the difference between integer and float division?
	Integer division will take the remainder into consideration, float division will ignore the remainder and always return a whole number.
What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
	Strings hold data intact in the way that it was written. You can use them to hold a phrase.
What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
	They are variables that only live in the method. You can use them if they are only applicable to a certain part of the code.
How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
	The basics? Oh geez. I felt like I had a general idea of how to do all of these problems, but I couldn't wrap them up perfectly.
