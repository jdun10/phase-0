# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 0. total Pseudocode
# make sure all pseudocode is commented out!

# Input: an array
# Output: the total of the numers in the array
# Steps to solve the problem.


# 1. total initial solution
# set total = 0
#  to add 1st number to total, then 2nd number, 3rd number and so on

# def total(array)
 # total = 0
 # array.each {|a| total += a}
 # total
# end


# 3. total refactored solution
def total(array)
  array.reduce (:+)
end


# 4. sentence_maker pseudocode
# make sure all pseudocode is commented out!
# Input: array
# Output: sentence
# Steps to solve the problem.
#  input selection of words
#  put a space in between each word and turn it into a string
#  capitalize the first word and return the string plus a "."


# 5. sentence_maker initial solution
# def sentence_maker (array)
 # sentence_maker = array.join(" ").capitalize
  
  # array.each  do |word|
  #   sentence_maker += word 
  # end
  # sentence_maker = sentence_maker.capitalize
  #return sentence_maker + "."
# end


# 6. sentence_maker refactored solution
def sentence_maker (array)
  sentence_maker = array.join(" ").capitalize
   return sentence_maker + "."
end
