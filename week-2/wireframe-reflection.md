A wireframe is a rough outline of what a site will look like and where its components will go.
Wireframing is helpful because the basic outline of a site can be changed far more easily as a picture than as an actual website.
I liked wireframing because it helped me visualize what my site would look like.
I mostly kept my first idea, but changed where my name and links to my other site would be on the blog wireframe.
I need to ask how to put images inline in markdown.
I just liked figuring out which things I wanted to display most prominently.
