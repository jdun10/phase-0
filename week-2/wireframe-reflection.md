 A wireframe is a rough outline of where a website's components will go.
 A wireframe is helpful because it be easily changed. You can show a client a wireframe or they could be a part of the wireframing design process and they could easily tell you what they like and don't like and it can be changed far more easily than an actual website could.
 I liked wireframing my site because it was an easy way to group its componenets and decide where they will go.
 I mostly kept my original idea, but I changed where the picture and links to my other sites would go on the blog wireframe.
 I need to ask how to get images inline in markdown.
