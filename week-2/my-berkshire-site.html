    I didn't think changing what I knew about html into a real site that much harder than I thought it would be. Since the challenge wasn't very complicated in the site structure, it was more a question of making sure everything had the correct closing tags on it. Trying to find the special characters was a curvball though, they didn't come out correctly at first and just looked wrong in the markdown. Going without formatting was a small struggle, we needed to focus on making sure eerything was in the correct place and nested as it should be. The good thing about HTML is that it's pretty simple and thus not too complicated to write, the bad thing is it's pretty simple and not too nice to look at as a finished project.  Tricks: remembering to indent is pretty helpful, I think it helps me see if something is out of place a little faster, it makes it easier to see if there are respective closing tags for the opening ones.
