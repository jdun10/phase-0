The 6 Phases of web design are Information Gathering, Planning, Design, Development, Testing and Delivery, and Maintenance.
My site's primary goal is to showcase my projects and progression in learning how to code and to provide ways for people to reach me.
Presently, my target audience is DBC instructors and other cohort mates. They would want to see how my projects are going and if I understand the material. In a few months, my site's target audience will be prospective employers and I want them to see my coding projects and be able to contact me.
The primary action for my site's users is to see my projects.
They should know that design is about solving problems, the problem is normally something like selling the most products or getting information to the most people. User experience is about setting up the site in a coherent way.
The user experience is mostly about making it as easy as possible because people will leave your site if they don't like it.
I thought that using the relative path to the file was tedious. This may be mostly because I had trouble loading it correctly.
