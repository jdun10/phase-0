This relationship is one-to-one because each dog can only have one worst behavior, color, size, and best behavior. There are specific values that correspond to each dog they cannot truthfully be switched around.


What is a one-to-one database?
	A one-to-one database is when kind of like a hash in table form. Each characteristic goes to a specific, broader group and not to any other. If it cannot belong to another group, then it is a one-to-one relationship.

When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
	You would use a one-to-one database when there are specific characteristics that pertain to a larger group but don't apply to any other group.

What is a many-to-many database?
	Many-to-many means that a parent row may have many child rows and a child row could have many parent rows.

When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).
	I think that something that categorizes music like iTunes could have some many-to-many qualities. Sometimes, a song can fit a few genres or you might want to label different artists that collaborated on one song as a single artist so that you can group that song with the artist's other work.

What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
	I think that explaining database schemas is a lot more complicated than using them. Trying to explain the relationships and where qualities go and how they are related is far more complicated than just looking at the charts. I think that the charts themselves make sense and are easy to read.
